## Self Evaluation
Looking at the code we produced, we believe that we accomplished everything that we wanted to accomplish in the proposal. Initially, we planned to collect and create our own dataset from viewing different clips of Twitch streamers, and then capturing screenshots of moments where they expressed naturalistic (not acted) fear or surprise. Then, to make sure our data is authentic and not "faked" for entertainment, we would also record the context of the image by examining contextual cues, body language, physiological responses, and facial expressions. We followed this approach exactly - we created an Excel spreadsheet containing all of our data"
